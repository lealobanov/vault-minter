The VaultMinter resource is designed to allow the controlled minting of new tokens. Access to this resource should be strictly limited, ideally to admins or other highly trusted entities, to maintain the integrity of the token supply.

The VaultMinter provides a mintTokens function that takes two arguments: the amount of tokens to mint and a capability that implements the Receiver interface. Before proceeding, it validates that the provided capability can accept deposits. Once the capability is verified, the specified amount of tokens is added to the total minted supply, ensuring accurate tracking of the token supply.

Finally, the newly minted tokens are encapsulated in a Vault resource and deposited directly into the account associated with the provided Receiver capability.
